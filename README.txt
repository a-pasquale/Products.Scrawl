Description
===========

Scrawl is a dirt-simple blog product for Plone.  It copies the "News Item"
content type to create a "Blog Entry" (with a slightly tweaked view template)
and adds an alternative view to Smart Folders (blog_view).  Note that blog_view
shows either the description of each contained blog entry (if it exists) or the
entire body in it, so it's up to the user to limit those results in an intelligent
way so that page loads doesn't take too long.

Scrawl works in Plone 2.1, 2.5, and 3.0.

Installation
============

Installing using buildout
-------------------------

Simply add Products.Scrawl to your eggs list and rerun buildout.

Installing as an old-style product
----------------------------------

Download the old-style product tarball from http://plone.org/products/scrawl.

Place Scrawl in the Products directory of your Zope instance
and restart the server.

Final step: Add to your Plone site
----------------------------------

Either go to the 'Site Setup' page in Plone and click on
'Add/Remove Products' or use the Quick Installer in the ZMI.


Migration
=========

There is a basic migrator available for Quills -> Scrawl.  Read the docstring
in Products.Scrawl.Extensions.migrate_entries for more details.  YMMV.
